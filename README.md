This repository contains PyTorch implementations of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving Boundary Value Problems (BVPs), along with a comparative analysis of several Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) strategies.

The primary focus is on providing a framework for both standard PINN implementations and efficient HPO techniques for scientific machine learning applications.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **PINN Implementations:** Includes both **soft-constrained (SCPINN)** and **hard-constrained (HCPINN)** models that enforce physical laws by satisfying boundary conditions exactly.
* **Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO):** A comparative study of four HPO strategies:
    * Grid Search 
    * Random Search
    * Surrogate-Based Approaches (Bayesian Optimization)
    * Our novel **Mixed Grid-Random Search** strategy.
* **Published Research:** This repository contains the official code for our paper on an efficient HPO method.

## üîß Usage

### Running a PINN Model
To run a specific model, navigate to its directory and execute the script. For example:
```bash
cd models/helmholtz_2d_square_cylinder/
python HCPINN.py
```
For a more detailed, step-by-step guide, please see the tutorial in `notebooks/tutorial_running_a_pinn.ipynb`. [under construction...]

### Running an HPO Benchmark
To compare the different HPO strategies, you can run the benchmark script:
```bash
cd hpo/
python benchmark_all.py
```
